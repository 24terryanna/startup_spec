MAKE THIS HABIT
1. Pull the repository's latest changes from GitHub (git pull)
2. Make changes to the code
3. Commit the changes (git commit)
4. Push the changes to GitHub (git push)

- all deliverables must have 10 commits
  - how to commit:
    - Verify you have the latest code (git pull)
    - Refactor, test, and/or implement a small portion of cohesive code (test code test)
    - Commit and push (git commit git push)
    - Repeat
- git fetch: returns latest changes in github w/o changing repository
- git status: see what's missing in clones -> missing commit
