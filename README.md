## PNW Plant Pedia
# Startup Specification

Although I’m living in Utah now, I’m an Oregonian at heart! The Pacific Northwest will always be my favorite location on the earth. Growing up, my family and I often spent our weekends and summers outdoors- camping, hiking, biking, kayaking, swimming, going to the beach- you name it. I love studying the ecological systems of the PNW and learning more about plants’ roles in the ecosystem, which brings me to PNW Plant Pedia! This is a site that will provide novice educational opportunities for anyone interested in the plants of the Pacific Northwest. Viewers will be able to access a photographic encyclopedia and select any species of plant that intrigues them. From there, the site will take them to a specified page listing the plants common and scientific names, physical attributes, role in the ecosystem, and a fun fact! Anyone who visits the site will hopefully leave with more knowledge, interest, and care for the natural world.
